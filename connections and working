Hardware Connections:

You’ll need to connect the LCD to the ESP8266 using multiple GPIO pins. The following example assumes you’re using a 16x2 or 20x4 LCD display with an HD44780 driver in 4-bit mode.

Pin Mapping:

	•	RS (Register Select) → GPIO 5 (D1 on NodeMCU)
	•	E (Enable) → GPIO 4 (D2 on NodeMCU)
	•	D4 → GPIO 0 (D3 on NodeMCU)
	•	D5 → GPIO 2 (D4 on NodeMCU)
	•	D6 → GPIO 14 (D5 on NodeMCU)
	•	D7 → GPIO 12 (D6 on NodeMCU)
	•	VSS, RW connected to GND, and VDD connected to 5V.


How it Works:

	1.	The ESP8266 connects to your WiFi network and starts a simple web server.
	2.	When you access the ESP8266’s IP address in a web browser (e.g., http://192.168.x.x), a form is presented where you can enter a new message.
	3.	When you submit the form, the ESP8266 receives the new message and displays it on the LCD.
	4.	The web page also shows the current message on the notice board.

Key Components in the Code:

	•	LiquidCrystal Library: This handles communication between the ESP8266 and the LCD. You must connect the LCD using 4-bit mode (RS, EN, D4-D7).
	•	WiFiServer: This creates a web server that listens for incoming connections on port 80 (HTTP).
	•	Form Handling: The ESP8266 reads HTTP GET requests from the web form, extracts the message, and updates the LCD.

How to Use:

	1.	Upload the code to your ESP8266 using the Arduino IDE.
	2.	Connect your ESP8266 to the WiFi network.
	3.	Open a browser and type the ESP8266’s IP address (shown in the Serial Monitor) to access the web interface.
	4.	Type a new message in the form and click “Update” to change the text displayed on the LCD notice board.

This project provides a simple and effective way to update the content of your smart notice board remotely using only a web browser and your ESP8266.
